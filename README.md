# odin_landing_page
This is a responsive HTML/CSS landing page that is a part of the Odin Project. The main objective of this project was to learn how to properly use HTML and CSS to build a landing page for a mock company. With the help of Derek from Perpetual Education, I was able to make the page responsive for various screen sizes.
